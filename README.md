## 🚀 Deployment

### Backend (Node.js)
```bash
# Build
npm run build --workspace=server

# Run
npm start --workspace=server
```

### Frontend (React)
```bash
# Build
npm run build --workspace=client

# The build/ folder contains static files ready for CDN/hosting
```

## 📝 Environment Variables

### Server (.env)
```
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
ADMIN_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

### Client (.env)
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port already in use**
- Backend: Change `PORT` in `server/.env`
- Frontend: Edit `client/vite.config.js`

**Database errors**
- Ensure `server/dev.db` exists or re-run `npm run db:push --workspace=server`
- Check database path in `DATABASE_URL`

**Module not found**
- Run `npm install` from root directory
- Ensure both `server/` and `client/` have `node_modules/`

**API connection issues**
- Verify backend is running on configured port
- Check `VITE_API_URL` in client `.env`
